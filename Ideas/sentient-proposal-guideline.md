# Sentient Proposal Guideline Skill Idea

## Mission
Provide a dedicated skill that codifies the visual, tonal, and structural standards for Sentient client proposals so every outgoing document reflects the brand's premium positioning and consistent narrative.

## Why It Matters
- Ensures proposal creators have a single source of truth for applying Sentient's brand system to sales materials.
- Reduces review cycles by clarifying expectations for layout, messaging hierarchy, and required sections before drafting begins.
- Strengthens brand recognition and trust by enforcing consistent voice, visuals, and compliance checkpoints across all proposals.

## Primary Triggers
- "Show me the Sentient proposal guidelines."
- "What does a Sentient client proposal need to include?"
- "Outline the Sentient-compliant proposal structure for this opportunity."

## Inputs & Data Sources
1. **Sentient Brand Guidelines**: Core reference for typography, color usage, iconography, and voice principles.
2. **Existing Proposal Templates**: Current slides or documents used by sales teams to capture structural best practices.
3. **Regulatory & Compliance Requirements**: Any mandatory disclosures, legal language, or security statements that must appear in proposals.
4. **Case Study & Asset Library**: Reference materials that can be linked or embedded while staying on-brand.

## Output Structure
1. **Overview Summary**: Quick-start description of the purpose of the guidelines and how to use them.
2. **Brand Voice & Tone Rules**: Bullet list of voice attributes, dos and don'ts, and sample phrasing.
3. **Visual System Checklist**: Typography pairings, color palettes with usage notes, logo placement rules, and imagery direction.
4. **Core Proposal Sections**: Required modules such as Executive Summary, Solution Overview, Value Proof, Implementation, Pricing, and Next Steps, each with content prompts.
5. **Formatting Standards**: Page layout specs, margin guidance, data visualization styles, and file naming conventions.
6. **Approval Workflow & QA**: Steps for internal review, legal/compliance sign-off, and final export options (PDF, web deck, etc.).
7. **Reusable Assets Directory**: Links or references to approved templates, cover slides, icon sets, and boilerplate language.

## Execution Notes
- Cross-reference Sentient brand guideline assets to auto-populate color codes, typography names, and voice descriptors.
- Provide optional regional variations or addenda when regulatory language differs by market.
- Include interactive checklists or decision trees that prompt sellers to confirm each section meets standards.
- Offer quick tips for adapting proposals to specific industries while preserving brand tone and visuals.
- Surface recent high-performing proposal examples for inspiration, tagging each with industry and deal stage metadata.

## Open Questions
- Should the skill generate a downloadable style packet or remain a conversational guide within the assistant?
- Do we need integration points with document editors (e.g., Google Slides, PowerPoint) to apply the guidelines automatically?
- What governance model keeps the guidelines updated as the brand evolves?
