## Today's Tasks

### 🟡 Priority 2: Skill Management ✅ Done

#### 1.1 ✅ Compare registered vs folder skills
- **Action:** List all skills registered in Cowork and all skill folders in the workspace, compare, and write a markdown report to Knowledge/
- **Delegate:** Alex (Dev)
- **Effort:** ~10 mins

#### 1.2 ✅ Rename sentient-brand-guideline folder to sentient-brand-guidelines
- **Action:** Rename the `sentient-brand-guideline` folder to `sentient-brand-guidelines` (add trailing "s") to match the registered Cowork skill name
- **Delegate:** Alex (Dev)
- **Effort:** ~2 mins

#### 1.3 ✅ Explore consolidating email skills into a single email-handling skill
- **Action:** Review all email-related skills (recent-emails, starred-email, list-emails, draft-email, monitor-stakeholders, actioned-emails, topic-emails), analyse overlaps and dependencies, and write a feasibility report with proposed sub-command architecture to Ideas/
- **Delegate:** Alex (Dev)
- **Effort:** ~30 mins

#### 1.4 ✅ Merge all email skills into daily-emails
- **Action:** Create a new `daily-emails` skill that consolidates all 7 email skills (recent-emails, starred-email, actioned-emails, topic-emails, list-emails, monitor-stakeholders, draft-email) into a single skill with sub-commands. Use the feasibility report in Ideas/email-handling-consolidation.md as a reference. Create `daily-emails/skill.md` with sub-command routing, shared query/formatting logic, and skill-specific sections.
- **Delegate:** Alex (Dev)
- **Effort:** ~3.5 hours

#### 1.5 ✅ Update stakeholders sub-command fallback behaviour
- **Action:** Update the stakeholders sub-command in daily-emails to prompt the user when Stakeholder_Monitoring.md is not found — offer to provide a file or fall back to the recent sub-command
- **Delegate:** Alex (Dev)
- **Effort:** ~2 mins

#### 1.6 ✅ Standardise default time horizon to 48 hours across all sub-commands
- **Action:** Update all retrieval sub-commands in daily-emails to default to 48 hours instead of mixed defaults (24h, 30d). Covers recent, starred, actioned (sent window), topic, and stakeholders.
- **Delegate:** Alex (Dev)
- **Effort:** ~5 mins
