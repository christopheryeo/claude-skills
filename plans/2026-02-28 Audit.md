# Daily Plan Audit — 28 February 2026

---

## 1.1 Compare registered vs folder skills
**Status:** ✅ Done
**Files:** `Knowledge/Skills_Comparison_2026-02-28.md`
**Objective:** Cross-reference Claude Cowork registered skills against local workspace folders to identify gaps, undeployed skills, and naming discrepancies.
**Verification:**
- [x] Extracted 33 registered skills from the Cowork system skill list
- [x] Listed 30 skill folders from the workspace (excluding non-skill directories)
- [x] Identified 25 matched skills present in both places
- [x] Flagged 8 registered-only skills as expected core/platform skills
- [x] Flagged 7 folder-only skills as undeployed (actioned-emails, new-proposal, new-quotation, presentation-jobs, project-pulse-brief, smartchat-service-costs, topic-emails)
- [x] Noted naming discrepancy: sentient-brand-guideline vs sentient-brand-guidelines
- [x] Markdown report written to Knowledge folder

## 1.2 Rename sentient-brand-guideline folder to sentient-brand-guidelines
**Status:** ✅ Done
**Files:** `sentient-brand-guidelines/` (renamed from `sentient-brand-guideline/`)
**Objective:** Fix folder naming mismatch so the local folder matches the registered Cowork skill name.
**Verification:**
- [x] Renamed `sentient-brand-guideline` → `sentient-brand-guidelines`
- [x] Confirmed renamed folder exists at expected path
- [x] No other references to old name requiring update

## 1.3 Explore consolidating email skills into a single email-handling skill
**Status:** ✅ Done
**Files:** `Ideas/email-handling-consolidation.md`
**Objective:** Analyse all 7 email-related skills for overlaps, dependencies, and feasibility of consolidation into a single sub-command skill.
**Verification:**
- [x] Read all 7 skill definitions (recent-emails, starred-email, list-emails, draft-email, monitor-stakeholders, actioned-emails, topic-emails)
- [x] Mapped dependency chain — 5 of 7 skills depend on list-emails as formatter
- [x] Identified high-overlap areas: query construction, thread reading strategy, summary generation, link building, guard rails
- [x] Identified unique logic per skill that must be preserved (stakeholder file, HTML drafting, dual-window merge, relevance scoring)
- [x] Evaluated 3 options: Full consolidation (A), Partial consolidation (B), Shared library (C)
- [x] Recommended Option B — consolidate 4 retrieval skills + list-emails into `email-handling`, keep monitor-stakeholders and draft-email separate (7 → 3 skills)
- [x] Estimated implementation effort at ~3.5 hours
- [x] Report written to Ideas/ folder

## 1.4 Merge all email skills into daily-emails
**Status:** ✅ Done
**Files:** `daily-emails/skill.md`
**Objective:** Create a unified `daily-emails` skill consolidating all 7 email skills into a single file with sub-command routing, shared logic, and skill-specific sections.
**Verification:**
- [x] Created `daily-emails/` folder and `skill.md` (307 lines, under 500-line limit)
- [x] YAML frontmatter with name and comprehensive description covering all 7 use cases
- [x] Sub-command routing table maps trigger phrases to 6 sub-commands: recent, starred, actioned, topic, stakeholders, draft
- [x] Shared Gmail tools section consolidates tool references
- [x] Shared query construction section eliminates duplication across 5 retrieval sub-commands
- [x] Shared token efficiency rules applied uniformly (max 10/category, selective thread reading priorities)
- [x] Shared output formatting absorbs list-emails — executive table template, status icons, link format, additional sections, quality checklist all built-in
- [x] Sub-command RECENT: inbox/sent/drafts/starred, 48h default, newsletter filtering, dedup, ≤30-word summaries
- [x] Sub-command STARRED: 48h default, full thread reads, follow-up extraction, snapshot header
- [x] Sub-command ACTIONED: dual windows (48h sent / 7d starred), metadata-only for sent, dedup sent+starred
- [x] Sub-command TOPIC: keyword search, 48h default, spotlight threads, top correspondents, suggested next steps
- [x] Sub-command STAKEHOLDERS: reads Stakeholder_Monitoring.md, 48h default, groups by stakeholder, monitoring notes integration, silent groups reporting
- [x] Sub-command DRAFT: thread identification, Mode A/B, HTML composition (no wrapper, inline styles, sign-off), reply-all logic, gmail_create_draft_reply with body_type html, never-send safeguard
- [x] Guard rails section covering all sub-commands
- [x] Automated verification passed 14/14 checklist items

## 1.5 Update stakeholders sub-command fallback behaviour
**Status:** ✅ Done
**Files:** `daily-emails/skill.md`
**Objective:** Update stakeholders sub-command to prompt the user when no stakeholder file is found, offering to provide a file or fall back to the recent sub-command.
**Verification:**
- [x] Updated step 2 of stakeholders sub-command: now asks user to provide a file or fall back to recent
- [x] Fallback executes the recent sub-command if user chooses that option
- [x] Change confirmed in skill.md

## 1.6 Standardise default time horizon to 48 hours across all sub-commands
**Status:** ✅ Done
**Files:** `daily-emails/skill.md`
**Objective:** Update all retrieval sub-commands to default to 48 hours for consistent behaviour across the unified skill.
**Verification:**
- [x] RECENT: updated from 24 hours → 48 hours
- [x] STARRED: updated from 30 days → 48 hours
- [x] ACTIONED (sent window): updated from 24 hours → 48 hours (starred window remains 7 days)
- [x] TOPIC: added explicit 48-hour default (was user-specified only)
- [x] STAKEHOLDERS: updated from 24 hours → 48 hours, query updated from `newer_than:1d` → `newer_than:2d`
- [x] All 5 retrieval sub-commands now aligned on 48-hour default
