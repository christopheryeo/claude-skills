Selection criteria:
- Published within the last 24 hours (or most recent available)

## Best Practices

- **Keep context concise**: Maximum 1-2 sentences; focus on why the story matters, not every detail
- **Include direct links**: Always provide clickable source URLs for easy reference
- **Prioritize recency**: Prefer stories from today or yesterday; fall back to recent trending stories if nothing fresh available
- **Verify credibility**: Use established, reputable news sources only (avoid blogs, opinion pieces, or unknown sources)
- **Stick to facts**: Report what happened; avoid commentary or speculation
- **Balance coverage**: Include mix of business, politics, technology, and human interest stories
- **Use consistent formatting**: Maintain the structure above for easy scanning

## Automated Integration

The `scripts/fetch_news.py` script provides a template structure for integrating real news APIs. To activate:

1. Subscribe to a news API (NewsAPI.org, mediastack, Ezoic, etc.)
2. Update the `fetch_international_news()` and `fetch_singapore_news()` functions with actual API calls
3. Parse JSON responses to extract headlines, context, and URLs
4. Execute the script on a schedule (cron job, Lambda function, etc.)

## Tips for Quality Output

- If recent news is limited, include 1-2 day old stories rather than forcing outdated content
- Always verify URLs work before including them
- For Singapore news, prioritize CNA, Straits Times, and TODAY as primary sources
- For international news, Reuters, AP, and Bloomberg are most authoritative
