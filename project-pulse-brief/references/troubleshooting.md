# Troubleshooting Guide

## Missing or Late Updates
- Send reminders 48 and 12 hours before the deadline using the intake prompts
  listed in `references/configuration.md`.
- Escalate to the project owner's manager if the brief would ship without a
  critical update.

## Conflicting Status Signals
- Schedule a quick sync with the project lead to reconcile differences between
  reported status and delivery metrics.
- Document the agreed-upon status in the brief and note any assumptions so
  stakeholders understand the context.

## Overly Long Sections
- Limit each bullet to a single idea. Move deep dives into a linked appendix or
  shared document.
- Prioritize items that require executive action; move informational updates to a
  "parking lot" for future reference.

## Stakeholders Request Automation
- Clarify that this skill provides a low-friction, documentation-first workflow.
- If automation becomes necessary later, capture the requirements and treat it as
  a follow-on enhancement rather than scope for the current process.

## Maintaining Cadence
- Keep a running list of open actions and review it at the start of each drafting
  session.
- Rotate the brief curator role quarterly to avoid burnout while preserving
  institutional knowledge.
