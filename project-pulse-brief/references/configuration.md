# Curation Checklist & Section Guidelines

Use this guide to align your pulse brief with stakeholder expectations. Treat it
as a set of knobs you can adjust when populating the template—no scripting or
configuration files required.

## Recommended Sections
| Section | Purpose | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Portfolio Snapshot** | Provide overall health, major shifts, and critical calls to action. | Limit to 3 bullet points; always include next reporting date. |
| **Highlights** | Celebrate wins and momentum. | Focus on outcomes, not activity. Include owner initials for fast follow-up. |
| **Watchlist** | Flag items that need attention but are not blocking delivery yet. | Clarify trigger conditions that would escalate items into Risks. |
| **Risks & Blockers** | Document impediments, mitigation plans, and decision requests. | Assign an accountable owner and target resolution date. |
| **Upcoming Milestones** | Outline the next commitments and dependencies. | Link to delivery plans or roadmaps when possible. |

## Health Labels
Standardize language across projects to keep the brief scannable:

- **On Track** – Scope, schedule, and resources align with plan.
- **Watch** – Emerging concerns that require monitoring or support.
- **At Risk** – Critical path impacted; sponsor attention required.
- **No Status** – Awaiting update; follow up before publishing.

Use colored emoji or tags sparingly (e.g., ✅, ⚠️, ❗️) if your publishing channel
supports them. Otherwise, keep labels bolded for readability.

## Intake Prompts
When requesting updates from project leads, ask for:
- Project name and point of contact
- Health label (choose from list above)
- One-sentence summary of current progress
- Top win or highlight since last update
- Active blocker or risk, including mitigation status
- Next major milestone and date
- Support requests or decisions needed this week

Share these prompts in a recurring reminder so contributors know exactly what to
provide. Capture the replies in whatever tool your team already uses (email
thread, shared doc, lightweight form)—no dedicated worksheet is required.

## Editorial Review Tips
1. **Trim repetition** – collapse duplicate updates into a single bullet with
   shared owner.
2. **Surface decisions** – bold any asks that require leadership action before
   the next report.
3. **Preserve context** – if you drop details for brevity, link to the source doc
   or include one supporting bullet below the headline.
4. **Close the loop** – carry over unresolved actions to the next brief until
   resolved.

## Distribution Variants
Choose the method that best fits your stakeholders:
- Paste the markdown into an email or shared doc.
- Convert to slides for leadership meetings.
- Add as a section in your project workspace or knowledge base.

Each option uses the same source content; adapt formatting to match the medium.
