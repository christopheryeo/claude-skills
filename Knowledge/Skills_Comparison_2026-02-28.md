## Key Observations

### Registered but no local folder (expected)
These are **core Cowork skills** provided by the platform — they don't need a local folder:
algorithmic-art, brand-guidelines, docx, pdf, pptx, schedule, skill-creator, xlsx.

### Folder exists but not registered
These skills have source code in the workspace but are **not yet deployed** to Cowork:
actioned-emails, new-proposal, new-quotation, presentation-jobs, project-pulse-brief, smartchat-service-costs, topic-emails.

### Naming discrepancy
`sentient-brand-guidelines` is registered in Cowork, but the local folder is named `sentient-brand-guideline` (missing trailing "s"). This may cause sync or reference issues.
